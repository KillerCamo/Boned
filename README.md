# Introducing Boned!

A silly little minigame for multiplayer servers that takes tag to the next level by removing the hassle and problems of regular tag. Also it's very immature teehee

Simply install the datapack and have an operator run '/trigger BonedGameConfig' and press the Random Game Start option.

# How to play
As soon as the game is started a player will recieve a bone. The player must search for another player and hit them with the bone to get rid of it and tag them. When a player is tagged they will be affected by knockback. Each time a player is hit they will unlock an advancement annoucing how many times they've been tagged. Please note this has a cap of 25 and from playtesting usually we declare this player the loser.

The player who now has the bone cannot tag the previous player (No tagbacks baby)

The bone is binded to the player and they cannot get rid of it, throwing it on the floor, putting it in crafting slots, a container, or anything else will delete the item and return it to the current person who is it, this prevents any hassle of losing the item and restarting the game.

At any point operators can reset the game and clear the bone off any player, or transfer the bone from any player to a random online player to keep things interesting

# Fun Stuff

- **Totem Animation** : When a player hits another player with the bone, it will play the totem animation but with the bone item... it's really cool looking!

- **Bone growth** : Depending on how many times a player has been tagged, it will result in the bone changing length (Requires Resource Pack)

# Q&A 

**Q: Is the resource pack required?**

A: No, the resource pack is optional. All of the features the RP uses are disabled by default and are optional. It does not take anything away from the game. 

**Q: Why is the datapack marked as experimental?**

A: Boned is flagged as experimental because it adds a custom enchant for the bone stick to knockback only players that are taggable to prevent exploiting the item. While this shouldn't cause any issues always make sure to backup your world if you feel unsure!

**Q: Will this be backported?**

A: While I do have prototypes of Boned stemming all the way back to 1.19.4, it is unfortunately not in the plans due to how unperformant and messy the code was, and while I COULD rebuild older versions from scratch, I prefer to continue updating it for newer versions and utilize newer tech... so sorry!

**Q: I found a bug!**

A: Report it on the github issues page!
